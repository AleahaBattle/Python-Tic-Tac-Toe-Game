A Tic-Tac-Toe computer program that can intelligently respond to the playerâ€™s moves. Tic-Tac-Toe is normally played with two people. One player is X and the other player is O. Players take turns placing their X or O. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column, or diagonal, they win. When the board fills up with neither player winning, the game ends in a draw.
